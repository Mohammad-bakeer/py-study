1- she defined function for dealing cards
{
    def deal_cards():
        cards=[11,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10]
        card = random.choice(cards)
        return card
}

2- used a for loop to call function twice, used append like I did.

3- she then defined a function and used built in function "sum()" to do the get the total.

4- she modified it so when you get a sum of 21 (11+10) to return 0
{
    def calculate_score(cards):
        if sum(cards)==21 and len(cards) == 2:
            return 0
        return sum(cards)
}


5- she modifies it again so when we have a 11 and the total is greater than 21 we turn the the 11 to 1, using "in" and "remove" and "append"
{
    def calculate_score(cards):
        if sum(cards)==21 and len(cards) == 2:
            return 0
        
        if 11 in cards and sum(cards)>21:
            cards.remove(11)
            cards.append(1)

        return sum(cards)
}

6- from replit import clear
